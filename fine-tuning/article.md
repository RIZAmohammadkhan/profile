# Brainwashing Your AI

Fine-tuning your AI isn’t a cosmetic tweak — it’s a deliberate, data-driven reshaping of how the model behaves. Think of it as tailoring a suit: the base model gives you the fabric and structure; fine-tuning gives you the fit, the lapels, and the pocket square that make it unmistakably yours.

## What is fine-tuning?

Fine-tuning adapts a general-purpose model to a specific voice, task, or workflow. Where prompt-engineering nudges behavior at inference time, fine-tuning permanently adjusts model parameters so it reliably produces the kind of output you want — whether that’s concise legal summaries, an empathetic customer-support voice, or a witty in-product assistant.

Key differences at a glance:

* Prompt engineering: quick, inexpensive, reversible. Good for experimentation.
* Fine-tuning: longer-term investment that changes model behavior consistently.
* Retrieval (RAG): best for up-to-date facts or large knowledge bases — use it instead of fine-tuning when freshness matters.

## When to fine-tune (and when not to)

Consider fine-tuning when:

* You need consistent, repeatable behavior (tone, persona, safety constraints).
* Prompting becomes brittle or overly complex.
* You want a compact on-device model with specific capabilities.

Avoid fine-tuning if:

* You need real-time updates or frequently changing facts — use RAG.
* You lack high-quality, domain-specific data.
* The desired behavior can be achieved reliably with better prompts or system messages.

## Why it’s worth the effort

Good fine-tuning multiplies product value: reduced hallucinations for task-specific workflows, stronger brand voice, and fewer manual fixes. But the biggest lever is data quality. A small, well-curated dataset beats a big messy one every time.

Common failure modes:

* Inconsistent labels or examples that contradict each other.
* Too many short examples that don’t show full task context.
* Mixing formats (instructions vs. free chat) without standardization.

Real lesson: garbage in → unpredictable behavior out. Even strong base models will “learn” bad habits from noisy fine-tuning data.

## Building the dataset: practical checklist

1. **Format consistently** — each example should follow the same roles (system/user/assistant) and structure.
2. **Cover edge cases** — include negative examples and failure modes.
3. **Prefer clarity over quantity** — aim for 100+ high-quality examples to start; many teams see large gains with a few hundred to a few thousand examples depending on complexity.
4. **Train/validation split** — common split is 80/20 or 90/10. Validation should contain unseen, realistic prompts.
5. **Label intent and constraints** — include metadata (tags, task type, difficulty) if your pipeline supports it.
6. **Sanity-check outputs** — run automatic checks (format, length, forbidden content) and manual review for a sample.

## Example JSONL record (one line per record)

For a JSONL file, each line is a JSON object. Here’s a clear, minimal example you can extend:

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {"role": "system", "content": "BondBot: a suave, witty assistant with concise expert answers."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "What happened to Atlantis?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Atlantis is a legendary civilization lost to the sea; historians debate whether it's myth or memory."}
  ],
  "weight": 1,
  "metadata": {"topic": "mythology", "difficulty": "easy"}
}
```

Notes:

* Put each such object on its own line in your `.jsonl` file.
* `weight` (if supported) can be used by your fine-tuning pipeline to prefer some examples over others.
* Add `metadata` to enable filtering, sampling, or stratified validation.

---

## Evaluation and deployment

* **Metrics:** use task-specific metrics (accuracy, BLEU/ROUGE for summarization, helpfulness ratings).
* **Human review:** at least some percentage of outputs should be checked by reviewers before deployment.
* **Safety:** enforce guardrails (blocklists, post-processors) and test adversarial prompts.
* **Iterate:** fine-tuning is rarely “one and done.” Track failure cases and add targeted examples.

---

## Final tips

* Start with prompt engineering; fine-tune only when you need persistent, reliable behavior.
* Keep the dataset clean and focused. A little curation goes a long way.
* Combine fine-tuning (for voice/behavior) with RAG (for current facts) when appropriate.
