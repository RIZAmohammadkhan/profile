# On Small Systems

This article explores the philosophy of building small, dependable software. It serves as a comprehensive example of what you can do with Markdown on this site. You can use **bold text**, _italic text_, or even `inline code` to emphasize points.

## The Value of Simplicity

Clarity, simplicity, and good design are not just aesthetic goals; they are functional principles. When we build small, focused tools, we reduce the surface area for bugs and create software that is easier to maintain and understand.

A key principle is the Unix philosophy:
> "Write programs that do one thing and do it well. Write programs to work together."

This approach leads to a robust ecosystem of interoperable tools rather than monolithic applications that try to do everything.
